title: Registration for the OWASP CRS Community Summit 2023 - Dublin, Feb 14
---


On February 14, the CRS community will meet at the [Dublin Convention Center](https://www.theccd.ie) for the 2023 CRS Community Summit, the first summit after the pandemic.

[REGISTRATION](https://pretix.eu/CoreRuleSet/summit-2023/)

It has been a while since last we met and many things have happened since. So, there is a lot to talk about.

We start at 9 am local time in Liffey Hall 1 of the Convention Center.  
  
The program is still in the making, but please expect a variety of talks about CRS, ModSecurity and Coraza. Here is what we know:

- Welcoming address
- Ervin Hegedüs: My work on ... (project title not fixed yet)
- Where is CRS 4?
- A round-up of the 2022 Bug Bounty Program and how we handled the reports
- CRS 4 plugin architecture and an overview of existing plugins

Of course, there will be enough time to meet the team, integrators and fellow users.

After the “official” program we will go out together for dinner, paid for by our sponsors.

If you are interested to present yourself, then please get in touch. Slots are likely to be 25min of presentation + Q&amp;A. We are interested in anything CRS-centered, namely technical talks or stories from production.

Please check here for an updated program.

Attendance is free.

Please notice that our summit is co-hosted with the OWASP Global AppSec Europe conference in the same location, Feb 15 and 16. [We encourage you to register for the OWASP conference too.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-global-appsec-dublin-2023-tickets-428685398567) **A registration for the CRS Community Summit does not give you access to the OWASP AppSec conference**

The CRS Community Summit presents an opportunity to build ties, to get inspiration from the community and to understand what people are doing with CRS. We invite the whole CRS community, developers, integrators and users.

If you have further questions don’t be afraid to contact us.

We are looking very much forward to seeing you all in Dublin.

Cheers,

Christian Folini for the CRS team
