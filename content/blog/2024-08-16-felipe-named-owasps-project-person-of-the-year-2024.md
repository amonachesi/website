Felipe named OWASP’s Project Person of the Year 2024
The 2024 OWASP Waspy Awards winners are here – and CRS co-leader Felipe Zipitría has been awarded “Project Person of the Year”! This win is a well-earned confirmation for Felipe’s hard work for the CRS project and the open-source community in general.
The purpose of the WASPY Awards is to bring recognition to those individuals who are passionate about OWASP, who contribute hours of their own free time to the organization to help improve the cyber-security world, yet seem to go unrecognized. Individual members of the OWASP Foundation were invited to vote by e-mail.
Further winners of a WASPY are Martin Knobloch (Chapter Person of the Year) and Shruti Kulkarni (Event Person of the Year).
