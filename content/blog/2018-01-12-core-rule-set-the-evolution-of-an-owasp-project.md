title: 'Core Rule Set: The evolution of an OWASP Project [x-post]'
---


Let me put one thing straight: there are two things when we talk about [ModSecurity](https://www.modsecurity.org/). There is the naked ModSecurity engine running inside NGINX or Apache and there is the rule set that instructs the engine what to do. Many different rule sets exist. But the rule set with the largest user base (and longest name) is the [OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_ModSecurity_Core_Rule_Set_Project) or [CRS for short](https://coreruleset.org/).
