title: AppSec Podcast Interviewing CRS Project Co-Lead Christian Folini
---


Chris Romeo from the AppSec Podcast did an interview with our own Christian Folini during the AppSecEU conference in July. The 25min interview has been published lately.  
The interview discusses the project itself, the upcoming 3.1 release, plans to expand beyond ModSecurity and CRS fits into agile development.

Here is the link to the interview: <https://www.securityjourney.com/blog/crs-and-an-abstraction-layer-s04e02/>
