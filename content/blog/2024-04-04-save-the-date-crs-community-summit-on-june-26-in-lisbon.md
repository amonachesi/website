The CRS project will once again hold its Community Summit the day before [OWASP’s Global AppSec Conference](https://lisbon.globalappsec.org) – this year in the capital of Portugal.

The whole CRS community – users, developers, integrators, and sponsors – is invited to meet on Wednesday, June 26 for an exchange of thoughts, technical talks, and networking.

The program is still in the making. We plan a variety of talks about CRS 4, ModSecurity and Coraza. The following items will be part of the summit program:

- Welcome address
- Talk by GOLD sponsor United Security Providers: New USP WAF
- Talk by Adrian Winckles: CRS on a honeypot
- ...
- Dinner and drinks in Lisbon

As you can see, we are still open for further suggestions. If you want to present at the summit, please contact Christian Folini: *christian \[dot\] folini \[at\] owasp \[dot\] org*.

More information about the program as well as registration will be available in due time. For the moment, please save the date and spread the word!

Let’s meet in Lisbon!

Cheers,  
Christian and Felipe
