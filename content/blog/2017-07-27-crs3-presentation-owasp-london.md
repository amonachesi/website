OWASP London informed me that my CRS3 presentation will be live-streamed on the [OWASP London Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/OWASPLondon/). My talk will begin around 8pm UK time.

The presentation will be very similar to the one I held at AppSecEU in Belfast, but this time, we have a backup plan for the installation demo which failed due to beamer issues back in May.

A record of the stream will be available on YouTube afterwards, likely the [OWASP London channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-CfoAEpdpkB_jYrydYrqSA).
